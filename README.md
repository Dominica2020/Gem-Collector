# Here's how the app works:
- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
    - The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
    - When user clicks a gem, the score counter is updated.
- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
- The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

- When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. 
- All the crystals will have four new hidden values. 
- The score counter will reset to zero.
- The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses. 
- If player refreshes the page wins and loses count reset to zero.
